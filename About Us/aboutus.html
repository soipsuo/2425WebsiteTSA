My name is Sarim Ahmed, and I am the owner  <br>of Masala Mahel. I opened a restaurant here in <br>America because I wanted to spread my culture<br> from India. I want to show that vegetarian food can <br>be more than just healthy and that vegetarian food <br>can taste amazing. I found my love of cooking<br> through helping my mother in the kitchen. She is<br> one of my biggest inspirations for cooking since she <br>was going through her own struggles as a single mother<br> and still provided the best food she could.<br> That is what I wish to share in my restaurant, the<br> most love and care put into a dish no matter what.<br> The other inspiration I draw upon in my cooking is <br>Sanjeev Kapoor. I learned through his TV shows <br>and his many books on Indian cuisine to hone my <br>culinary skills.</p>


  <h1>The Restaurant</h1>
  <p>Masala Mahel has been running since 2008. The aim is to<br> keep an ambient and peaceful environment for everyone<br> in the restaurant at all times. The goal of this restaurant is<br> to show the delights and joys of Indian cuisine to any<br> individual without care to their background. Indian cuisine<br> can appeal to anyone, and that is what Masala Mahel<br> wishes to showcase.</p>
