My name is Sarim Ahmed, and I am the owner  <br>of Masala Mahel. I opened a restaurant here in <br>America because I wanted to spread my culture<br> from India. I want to show that vegetarian food can <br>be more than just healthy and that vegetarian food <br>can taste amazing. I found my love of cooking<br> through helping my mother in the kitchen. She is<br> one of my biggest inspirations for cooking since she <br>was going through her own struggles as a single mother<br> and still provided the best food she could.<br> That is what I wish to share in my restaurant, the<br> most love and care put into a dish no matter what.<br> The other inspiration I draw upon in my cooking is <br>Sanjeev Kapoor. I learned through his TV shows <br>and his many books on Indian cuisine to hone my <br>culinary skills.</p>

  <p>Masala Mahel has been running since 2008. The aim is to keep an ambient and peaceful environment for everyone in the restaurant at all times. The goal of this restaurant is to show the delights and joys of Indian cuisine to any individual without care to their background. Indian cuisine can appeal to anyone, and that is what Masala Mahel wishes to showcase.</p>
